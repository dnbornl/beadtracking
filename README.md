# Bead-Tracking Toolbox in MATLAB

## Purpose

This toolbox was specifically created for automatically detecting and tracking fluorescent microbeads in high-resolution microscopy images.

The code was developed by the Imaging, Signals, and Machine Learning Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in collaboration with the Developmental Neurobiology Department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

## Installation
